# SupplyAndDemandShop
Description: Modfies the prices in ShopGUIPlus depending on what people buy/sell

_This minecraft plugin was originally comissioned for SpectralMC. Because this was never implemented into SpectralMC (the owner sold the server), the source code has been uploaded to github for showcasing purposes. It runs on Spigot (or Paper + its forks) 1.8.8 and ShopGUIPlus 1.33.0 - 1.34.2. The description of this comission is below:_

### Supply and Demand Economy: 
Unlike most other servers the prices actually change on the shop. It is completely player driven, when you sell a large amount of one item the price of the item goes down while if you buy a lot of one item it goes up. (Revolutionary) No price will be the same for a long period of time so if you arenâ€™t versatile you will be obsolete. It is all based on what players actually use.
